Close your eyes. Slowly bring your awareness to your body, noticing any sensations without judgment.

No OTC medications are specifically for happiness.  However, if experiencing anxiety or sleep disturbances related to this milestone, consider OTC sleep aids (like diphenhydramine) or melatonin (follow package directions).  See a doctor if happiness is excessive, disruptive to daily life, or accompanied by racing thoughts, irritability, or decreased need for sleep. A psychiatrist or psychologist can provide further assessment and treatment if needed.\n\n\n**Remember**: I'm an AI coach. For medical concerns, please consult a professional."}]}
